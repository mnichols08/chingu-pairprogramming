# Session-03 - Animated / Dynamic Text in Background
Canomogollon and Mikey's Pair Programming Session
## Overview
This app was created for the Chingu Pair Programming session during the week of March 22nd. Our goal is to create a header with animated / dynamic text in the center similer to the functionality found [here](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_geometry_text_shapes) or [this codepen](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/rNwvmNb). 

## Requirements
- Webpack

## Motivation
Chigu brought us together and [canomogollon](https://www.github.com/canomogollon) came up with the idea out of the gate to make this idea.
